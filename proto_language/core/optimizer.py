"""Abstract base class for the search strategy that drives the optimization loop.

An ``Optimizer`` is the orchestrator of a single optimization stage: it owns the
``constructs`` under design and coordinates ``generators`` and ``constraints`` across
the propose-score-refine cycle. Each iteration it asks its generators for proposal
``Sequence`` objects on the target ``Segment`` pool, calls ``score_energy`` to evaluate
every ``Constraint`` (filters first, then weighted scorers) into one energy score per
proposal, then selects survivors that become each segment's ``result_sequences`` and seed
the next iteration. ``Optimizer`` is abstract — ``__init__`` and ``run`` are abstract — so
concrete strategies (MCMC, beam search, gradient, rejection sampling, cycling) subclass it
and register via the ``@optimizer`` decorator; this base supplies the shared scoring,
seed-derivation (``derive_seeds`` fans a parent seed out to per-generator/per-constraint
streams for reproducible runs), and export machinery. ``Program`` runs a list of optimizers
as ordered stages, reusing the same construct objects by identity.

Examples:
    Wire a concrete optimizer (the ABC is never instantiated directly) and run it:

    >>> from proto_language.core import Constraint, Construct, Program, Segment
    >>> from proto_language.generator import RandomNucleotideGenerator, RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig
    >>> from proto_language.optimizer import MCMCOptimizer, MCMCOptimizerConfig
    >>> from proto_language.constraint import gc_content_constraint
    >>> seg = Segment(length=20, sequence_type="dna")
    >>> gen = RandomNucleotideGenerator(RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig())
    >>> gen.assign(seg)
    >>> gc = Constraint(inputs=[seg], function=gc_content_constraint, function_config={"min_gc": 80, "max_gc": 90})
    >>> optimizer = MCMCOptimizer(
    ...     constructs=[Construct([seg])],
    ...     generators=[gen],
    ...     constraints=[gc],
    ...     config=MCMCOptimizerConfig(num_results=1, proposals_per_result=20, num_steps=10),
    ... )
    >>> program = Program(optimizers=[optimizer], num_results=1)

class Optimizer(ABC):
    """Base class for optimization algorithms.

    Coordinates multiple generators and constraints to search for optimal
    biological sequences through iterative optimization. Unlike generators
    which modify sequences directly, optimizers orchestrate the search process
    by coordinating generators, evaluating constraints, and making decisions
    about which sequences to keep.

    Pool Initialization:
        ``_initialize_sequence_pools()`` runs via ``_resolve_num_results()``,
        called during ``__init__()`` only when ``num_results`` is set on the
        config; otherwise resolution (and pool initialization) is deferred until
        ``Program.__init__()`` flows the program-level ``num_results`` to the
        optimizer. It is also called by ``Program.run_stage()`` before each
        subsequent optimizer. It reads from ``result_sequences`` (from previous
        optimizer) or ``original_sequence`` and initializes both pools by cycling
        through source to preserve diversity.

    Filter Constraints:
        Constraints with a threshold parameter act as binary filters that accept or reject
        proposals before scoring. Rejected proposals receive infinite penalty scores
        and skip all subsequent constraint evaluations, improving performance when
        constraints are computationally expensive.

        Filter evaluation order:
        1. All filter constraints (those with threshold set) are evaluated first
        2. Proposals must pass ALL filters (AND logic)
        3. Only accepted proposals are evaluated by scoring constraints
        4. Rejected proposals receive filter_penalty score (default: inf)

    Examples:
        Use a concrete subclass (never instantiate ``Optimizer`` directly):

        >>> from proto_language.core import Constraint, Construct, Program, Segment
