"""Top-level orchestrator that runs Optimizer stages over shared Constructs.

A ``Program`` owns the design's ``Construct`` objects and composes one or more
``Optimizer`` stages that run sequentially. ``run()`` walks the stages in order; each
stage drives the propose-score-refine loop (the optimizer asks its ``Generator`` for
proposal ``Sequence`` s, every ``Constraint`` scores them, and survivors become the
``Segment`` 's result ``Sequence`` s). Because all optimizers share the same construct
objects by identity, each stage's results flow into the next without manual handoff.
A program-level ``seed`` owns run determinism and ``num_results`` flows down to any
optimizer that does not set its own. After the run, ``constructs`` hold the final
sequences, ``energy_scores`` reports the final-stage energies (lower is better), and
``export()`` / ``to_dataframe()`` / ``to_fasta()`` emit results.

Examples:
    Build a single-stage program and inspect its final joined sequence:
    >>> from proto_language.constraint import gc_content_constraint
    >>> from proto_language.core import Constraint, Construct, Program, Segment
    >>> from proto_language.generator import (
    ...     RandomNucleotideGenerator,
    ...     RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig,
    ... )
    >>> from proto_language.optimizer import MCMCOptimizer, MCMCOptimizerConfig
    >>> seg = Segment(length=20, sequence_type="dna")
    >>> construct = Construct([seg])
    >>> gen = RandomNucleotideGenerator(RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig())
    >>> gen.assign(seg)
    >>> gc = Constraint(
    ...     inputs=[seg],
    ...     function=gc_content_constraint,
    ...     function_config={"min_gc": 80, "max_gc": 90},
    ... )
    >>> optimizer = MCMCOptimizer(
    ...     constructs=[construct],
    ...     generators=[gen],
    ...     constraints=[gc],
    ...     config=MCMCOptimizerConfig(num_results=1, proposals_per_result=20, num_steps=10),
    ... )
    >>> program = Program(optimizers=[optimizer], num_results=1)
    >>> program.run()
    >>> program.constructs[0].joined_sequences[0]  # the optimized DNA Sequence

    Write a results folder (tables + FASTA + assets/) to disk:
    >>> program.export(path="run_out")  # PosixPath('run_out')

class Program:
    """Programs represent user-defined biological designs.

    This class supports sequential execution of multiple optimizers, where each
    optimizer builds on the results of the previous one. All optimizers must
    share the same construct objects to ensure state persistence.

    Optimizer Handoff Contract:
        When running multiple optimizers sequentially, the Program ensures proper
        state transfer between stages:

        **After each optimizer completes:**

        Optimizers are responsible for their own sorting. Rejection Sampling keeps
        ``result_sequences`` sorted by energy throughout its run. Other
        optimizers' natural ordering is preserved as-is.

        **Before the next optimizer runs:**

        1. ``_initialize_sequence_pools()`` reads from ``result_sequences``
           (or ``original_sequence`` if first optimizer)
        2. Both ``result_sequences`` and ``proposal_sequences`` are initialized by
           cycling through source to preserve diversity when pool sizes differ
           (e.g., source=[A,B,C], num_results=5 -> [A,B,C,A,B])

        **Optimizer-specific behavior:**

        - **Rejection Sampling**: Clears ``result_sequences`` and repopulates dynamically
          during run (always sorted by energy)
        - **MCMC**: Uses ``result_sequences`` as parallel trajectories, overwrites
          ``proposal_sequences`` each step via ``_populate_proposal_sequences()``
        - **CyclingOptimizer**: Works directly on ``proposal_sequences``
        - **BeamSearch**: Ignores previous state entirely, starts fresh from configured prompt

    Examples:
        Sequential optimization with Rejection Sampling followed by MCMC:
        >>> from proto_language.optimizer import (
        ...     RejectionSamplingOptimizer,
        ...     RejectionSamplingOptimizerConfig,
        ...     MCMCOptimizer,

        ...     generators=[broad_mutation_gen],

        ...     config=RejectionSamplingOptimizerConfig(num_samples=100, num_results=3),
        ... )
        >>>
